# QuestBuddy
Are you tired of the daily chores and grind of life? Do you wish that something could take those chores and make them more fun?

QuestBuddy is my personal attempt to do this. The idea is simple: Produce a list of tasks, when you finish a task, you complete a quest. When you complete a quest,
you get a reward! This basic gameplay loop is at the core of this app. With it, you will get all the encouragement you need to finish all of those pesky chores you
have to get done!

## Lessons Learned
- **TypeScript and Tailwind**: This project was a learning curve for working with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Mastering the intricacies of types and utility classes significantly boosted the quality of my code.

- **Scope Management**: One major challenge was managing the scope of the project. I had to revisit and revise my databases multiple times to narrow down the project's scope, ensuring it was manageable and focused.

- **Time Management**: While I was unable to complete all the planned functionalities, this experience was invaluable for improving my time management skills. It's a lesson I'll carry forward in future projects to better plan and execute.

## Next Steps
